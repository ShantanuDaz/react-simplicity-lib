# React Simplicity Library 🛠️

**react-simplicity-lib** is a collection of reusable React components that simplify UI development. This library includes various components like `Toggle`, `Modal`, `Tabs`, `HoverCard`, `Table`, and more, designed for easy integration and customization.

I created this after facing lot of problems in creating simple components so I decided to solve this issue for everyone. The components are simple and elegant. I am sure you will enjoy them ❤️ Please check out this [documentation](https://react-simplicity.netlify.app/)

## **Note**

This library is built entirely with **React JS, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it extremely **lightweight** and **lightning-fast ⚡**

## **Installation**

```bash
npm install react-simplicity-lib
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-simplicity-lib
```

## **Usage**

Import and use the components individually:

```javascript
import { Toggle, Tabs, Tab, Modal } from "react-simplicity-lib";
```

Example of `Tabs` Component:

```jsx
<Tabs Tabs={["Happy", "Sad", "Love"]}>
  <Tab className="tab-display">😊</Tab>
  <Tab className="tab-display">😔</Tab>
  <Tab className="tab-display">❤️</Tab>
</Tabs>
```
