# React Simplicity Library üõ†Ô∏è

**react-simplicity-lib** is a collection of reusable React components that simplify UI development. This library includes various components like `Toggle`, `Modal`, `Tabs`, `HoverCard`, `Table`, and more, designed for easy integration and customization.

I created this after facing lot of problems in creating simple components so I decided to solve this issue for everyone. The components are simple and elegant. I am sure you will enjoy them ‚ù§Ô∏è Please check out this [documentation](https://react-simplicity.netlify.app/)

## **Note**

or with Yarn:

```bash

## **Usage**

Import and use the components individually:
